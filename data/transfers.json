    "question": "Transfer of Ownership, Change of Registrant and Domain Trades",
    "answer": "The transfer of domain ownership from one individual or organization to another is governed by ICANN's Inter-Registrar Transfer Policy. The process is sometimes also referred to as a change of Registrant or domain trade. Transferring ownership of a domain is accomplished by updating the owner contact information in Whois. Under the current ICANN policy, both the old Registrant, and new Registrant must approve modifications to this information. A confirmation email is sent to both the old Registrant email and the new Registrant email. Each party must follow the link provided to a confirmation page, where they grant approval of the transfer. This same process also comes into play when minor updates to Whois contact information are made. Please contact your provider if you are unsure of how to update this information.",

    "question": "How long will it take to transfer my domain?",
    "answer": "The transfer process is automated and can take up to 7 days to complete. That said, we do our part to make the process as quick as possible. If you are transferring your domain away from Tucows, we send a courtesy confirmation email, allowing you to grant permission for us to release the domain sooner. If you are transferring your domain to Tucows via one of our affiliated Domain Providers, we initiate the transfer upon your request. It's then up to your old registrar to release the domain.",
